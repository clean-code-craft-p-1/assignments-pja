## Purpose

Build habits for productivity and reliability.

## Cycle of value

The cycle of value is a cycle of writing code, testing it, and then refactoring it to improve its quality.
This cycle keeps the code healthy and easy to maintain.
It's like brushing your teeth - do it every day to keep your teeth healthy.

    F --> C["Continuous improvement<br>Shift left"]

```

## LLM Ecosystem

Recognize:

1. Your prompt
1. Its context
1. Model

## Modularity

Modularity is the practice of breaking down code into smaller pieces. This makes it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

However, cutting code arbitrarily can lead to confusion. [Naming by purpose](naming.md) is the easiest way to validate if you're on the right path. Explore this, and more ways to reduce cognitive load.

Other principles that help in a beneficial cut:

### Separate by lifecycle

Keep stable code separate from evolving code.
The feature to "display the summary" can change by user-preference.
Hence, separate it from "reading the data", which goes by a standard / agreed interface.

### Name by purpose

Names for files, classes, or functions should be self-evident.
A good name conveys purpose - without digging further into their code or comments.
This saves time when reading code.

### Avoid side effects

Side effects are changes to state - display, storage, network, etc.
They bring dependency. Isolate your logic into pure functions that return a value without changing the state.
Keep dependencies separate.

### Inject dependencies

When it isn't possible to isolate with pure functions, inject dependencies.
Pass in the dependencies as parameters, rather than hardcoding them.
This makes it easy to mock the dependencies in tests, and to swap them out in production.

## Tests

Follow the FIRST principles for writing tests:

| Principle | Enables | Benefits |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Fast      | Frequent execution | Find issues early |
| Independent| Isolation of tests | Easier failure diagnosis |
| Repeatable | Consistent results | Stable tests, low maintenance |
| Self-validating| Automatic pass/fail | Reduced manual effort - single Pass/Fail result |
| Thorough   | Coverage with strong asserts | Passing tests ensure customer satisfaction |
